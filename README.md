# rainbow-theme
A colorful theme for vim written in vim9script.

## Why this theme
I tested many themes and didn't find one that match exactly my needs.
This is also an opportunity to better understand how vim works.
I do not found many themes written with vim9script, that's a good reason to make it public. 
I hope it will help people who search a bootstrap for their themes
